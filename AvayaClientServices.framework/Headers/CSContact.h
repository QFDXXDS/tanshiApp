/**
 * Enumeration that describes the types of the ACL-confirm policy handling.
 * <p>
 * When a request to start watching presence of some user is issued by the client
 * the presence server the client is connected to relies on Access Information Control policy,
 * also known as Access Control List (ACL), to decide whether the requesting user has permissions
 * to get the presence of the desired user. 
 * <p>
 * The ACL policy applies to a particular presentity and has the following three options:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>"ALLOW" means all requests are to be serviced and presence is provided to the requesting user.</li>
 *   <li>"BLOCK" means all requests are politely ignored by a presence server and presence is not provided.</li>
 *	 <li>"CONFIRM" means that a presence request is serviced only if the remote user (presentity) explicitly allows that via a pop-up dialog.</li>	
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The "CONFIRM" option implies that each presence watcher request results in a pop-up message displayed on a presentity side
 * which may introduce undesired distraction and bad experience for the remote user. 
 * <p>
 * The CSAccessControlBehavior setting can be used to avoid this behavior when the start presence request is issued.
 * <ul>
 *   <li>If set to CSAccessControlBehaviorNone, "CONFIRM" policy would be treated as "BLOCK" by the presence server.</li>
 *   <li>If set to CSAccessControlBehaviorPrompt, "CONFIRM" policy will result in requesting the remote user to explicitly allow watching their presence.</li>
